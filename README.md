# csgo-rank-icons

A collection of CS:GO rank icons extracted straight from the game's binaries

The sole reason behind this repo is because I couldn't find any original icon sets, thus I set out to find the original icons myself and share them with the world

# How to extract from CS:GO binaries yourself

* Get and install GCFScape (https://nemstools.github.io/pages/GCFScape-Download.html)
* Open GCFScape, select `Open` in the toolbar and locate CS:GO's csgo directory (usually C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo)
* Pick any `.vpk` file (most of the useful assets can be found inside `pak01_dir.vpk`)
* Navigate the contents, if you find whatever you like, extract it by right-clicking the folder/file and selecting extract
